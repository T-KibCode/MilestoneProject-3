# Introduction
This project is the third one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitute.net).

It is a user interactive movie review website.  The aim is to have users be able to search up movies, read a shot description and have the ability (if registered) to leave a comment/review on the page for that particular movie.  
The goal is to have a gently guided experience for the user towards this goal with intuitive design of the project, starting from the search function being the main draw of their attention, the ability for them to find information on the film, both spoiler and spoiler free, create a registered account in order to be able to leave user scores after seeing a film, and to be able to edit any previous posts made by the user. 

The reason for my choosing of this project specifically, is because I wanted the user experience to be a social one in relation to the films, both being able to find a film to watch in a specific genre, whilst also allowing the user to leave their own thoughts on the site for others to see. This will allow me to use a variety of different language models to achieve this and should hopefully demonstrate the skills within the project.

  ### User Stories
  
  ##### First Time Visitor Goals
  As a first time visitor I want:  
  - the search function for movie reviews to be clear, front and center  
  - to be able to filter by multiple fields, such as genre, year of release, age rating   
  - to be able to create user account to interact with other users 
  
  ##### Return/frequent Visitor Goals.
  As a return/frequent visitor I want:  
  - to be able to score films/movies I have seen.
  - to be able to save movies to a personal favourites page to keep personal track.
  - to be able to leave comment reviews on individual movie pages with the ability to edit the comments.
  - to allow the registered user to be able to filter if they see user reviews or not. 
  
  ##### Website's Owner Goals.
  As the developer I want:
  - to correctly create a relational database that pulls the information the user requires of their search i.e after searching a certain parameter, being able to filter down the returned results such as, release date filter being applied when searching the horrow genre to find movies released in a certain window whether that be annual or seasonal.
  - to create a comments section that allows user's to leave word-limited reviews following the CRUD format. 
  - to lead the user down a pusedo-constructed path, in order to provide a semi-streamlined experience with the website.
  - to either create a database, or use an available API call for a pre-existing movie database that can be used to pull names, lead actors, directors, release dates and series links in to the site. 
  - to create a seperate database for the users to write to i.e comments/reviews etc, movies scores etc.
